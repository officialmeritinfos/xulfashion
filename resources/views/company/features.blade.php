                                The integrated booking system at {{$siteName}} is designed to streamline the booking experience for
                                both merchants and customers. This feature makes it easier for fashion designers, tailors, models,
                                and other merchants to manage appointments, while providing a user-friendly interface for
                                clients to book services. Currently, the booking system is seamlessly integrated into the
                                platform, offering a basic structure that efficiently handles scheduling and appointments.

                                Our booking system simplifies the process of scheduling appointments for services such as
                                fittings, consultations, and photoshoots. Merchants can set up their availability, and customers
                                can book time slots that work best for them. The system automatically updates to reflect booked
                                slots, reducing the risk of double-bookings and miscommunications. With just a few clicks,
                                both merchants and clients can easily manage their appointments, making the whole process smooth and efficient.

                                One of the most convenient aspects of our integrated booking system is the automated
                                reminder feature. Once a customer schedules an appointment, they receive confirmation
                                emails and reminders to ensure they donâ€™t miss their bookings. This feature reduces
                                no-shows and last-minute cancellations, helping merchants maintain a more consistent and
                                reliable schedule. Automated reminders are customizable, allowing merchants to adjust
                                the timing and content of notifications based on their needs.
